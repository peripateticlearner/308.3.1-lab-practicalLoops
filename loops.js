// -------------------ALAB 308.3.1 - Practical Loops-------------------------------
// --------------------- Part One: Fizz Buzz ---------

    if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) { // is divisible by both 3 and 5

        } else { // if not divisible by 3 or 5 log the number
          console.log(i)
        }
    }


// ------------------- Part Two: Prime Time ------------
let nextPrime = 20 // startng number

// check numbers until a prime is found
while (true) {
    console.log(`Checking number: ${nextPrime}`); // log current number being checked
    let isPrime = true; // assume initially its prime
    
    // loop through numbers from 2 to one less than the nextPrime to check if its divisible 
    for (let i = 2; i < nextPrime; i++) {
        console.log(`Testing divisor: ${i}`); // log each divisor being tested
        if (nextPrime % i === 0) { // if it is divisible it's not prime
            console.log(`${nextPrime} is divisible by ${i}, not prime.`);
            isPrime = false; // make it not prime
            break; // leave the loop
        }
    }

    // since no divisors were found, nextPrime is prime
    if (isPrime) {
        console.log(`${nextPrime} is prime!`); // log the found prime number
        break; // leave the loop
    }
    nextPrime++; // if its not a prime, move to the next number
}
